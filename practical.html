  	     <h2>Getting here</h2>     
            <p>
              Click on the link to find out if you need to fulfill <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visa_policy_of_Mexico">visa requirements</a>. 
              Once arriving at Benito Juarez Airport, make sure you buy an <a href="https://www.aicm.com.mx/en/passengers/transportation/taxis">authorized taxi</a> ticket to your hotel. Authorized taxis are a little pricier than street cabs, but they are a lot safer and still very reasonably priced. A taxi ride from the airport to your hotel would range between MX$200  to $400, depending on the location. Make sure that you are getting the standard, "Sedan" service if you are less than 4 people since the "Ejecutivo" option is more expensive. We strongly <strong>discourage the use of non-authorized taxis</strong> at the airport, since it is not only dangerous but also <strong>illegal</strong>. You will know if your taxi is authorized if you need to buy a ticket from a stand.

              The workshop will be held at <a href="https://www.colmex.mx">El Colegio de M&eacutexico</a>, Auditorium "Alfonso Reyes".

            <h2>Getting around</h2>     
            <p>
              Accessing El Colegio de M&eacutexico is easy by taxi or Uber. Public transport is not a good option, since there are no metro stations in the area and buses are not easy to get around. <a href="https://www.taxifarefinder.com/main.php?city=Mexico-City-Mexico">This site</a> will help you estimate cab fares in Mexico City. As we said, taxis are inexpensive, but it is safer that you take the slightly pricier "sitio" taxis (i.e. from taxi stands) rather than flagging them on the street. Please refrain to do so. Uber is also a safe option. Make sure you download the app before coming to the workshop.

            <h2>Safety</h2>
            <p>
              Although Mexico City is fairly safe in our national context,  please be prudent. Here are some tips you should keep in mind when you are here:
              <ul>
                <li> Keep an eye on your belongings at all times. </li>
                <li> Avoid walking at night. If you are going out, it is a good idea to arrive and leave by taxi/uber. </li>
                <li> Remember only to use Sitio Taxis or Uber. </li>
                <li> If you need to use an ATM, do it during daylight hours and, if possible, use those located inside shops and malls rather than on the street. There is is an ATM inside El Colegio de M&eacutexico. This is of course the safest option :) </li>
                <li> Keep your valuables in your hotel room (including your passport). We know that you will need your laptop for the conference but otherwise try not to carry expensive things. </li>
                <li> It is a very good idea to make sure your phone has roaming and internet service in Mexico City. Having an internet connexion at all times will help you to use Uber, Google maps, and contact the organizers at any time, should you need anything. (Obviously, at the venue you will have wi-fi at all times). </li>
              </ul>
